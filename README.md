# todo-js

This is a sample project I do to practice my vanilla JS skills. Making a To-Do App has always been a great way to try out a new language. Start adding new To-Do items to your list and get things done!


# Why?

I was having some trouble at work when dealing with JS code, so I wanted to start to learn. I was reading some online sources and they all seemed like vanilla JS could do almost anything I need to do a to-do application. So I started implementing this project and it took around 2 hours.

# What I learned?

I learned how to create and use **objects** in JS, how to **manipulate the DOM** based on **user's actions**, and JS can be **fun** too. 

# Next?

Currently it only works until you refresh your browser's tab ðŸ¤“. Next step for me is to learn about storage in JS, and maybe I could implement an API to interact with so I learn how to do those operations in JS too.
